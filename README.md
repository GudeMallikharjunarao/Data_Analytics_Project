# Data_Analytics_Project:

This project aims to demonstrate the end-to-end process of data analytics, from data acquisition to data cleaning, storage, analysis, and visualization, showcasing proficiency in Python, SQL, and Power BI.

Data Source: Kaggle API for dataset acquisition.

Technologies Used:

Python for data processing and scripting.
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
Kaggle API for dataset acquisition.
SQL Server for data storage and querying.
SQL for analysis and querying.
Power BI for Data Visualization.


Workflow:

Use Kaggle API to download dataset into Python environment.
Process, clean, and analyze data using Pandas for EDA.
Connect to PostgreSQL Server using libraries like pyodbc or sqlalchemy.
Create SQL database and tables mirroring cleaned dataset structure.
Load cleaned data from Pandas DataFrames into  PostgreSQL tables.
Perform data analysis and answer questions using SQL queries.
Connected the PostgreSQL server as a datasource to Power BI for creating insightful visualizations.
