Used Python and Pandas for Data Processing, Data Cleaning and Data Manipulation.

Data Source: Kaggle API for dataset acquisition.

Technologies Used:

Python for data processing and scripting.
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
Kaggle API for dataset acquisition.
SQL Server for data storage and querying.
SQL for analysis and querying.

Workflow:

Use Kaggle API to download dataset into Python environment.
Process, clean, and analyze data using Pandas for EDA.
Connect to PostgreSQL Server using libraries like pyodbc or sqlalchemy.
Create SQL database and tables mirroring cleaned dataset structure.
Load cleaned data from Pandas DataFrames into  PostgreSQL tables.
